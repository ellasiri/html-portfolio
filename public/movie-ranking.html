<h1>The Best Movies According to Siri</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time and why</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This movie made me believe in love and perserverance. Watching Sophie grow confident and return to a young woman as Howl steadily falls in love with her? Yes. And it's a Studio Ghibli film so the animation is whimsical, vibrant, and captures emotion in a way that makes it feel cozy and lovely.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Honestly, this is just a really good movie but I think the idea that our love (noticing a theme here?) transcends space and time and matter is such a beautiful concept to me. I also adore the cast and the music is truly transcendant. Hans Zimmer is a musical genius and I sometiems listen to the score while I work. Plus, it is a visually compelling film, too. All around good. And I cried.</p>
<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
<p>Another just genuine banger of a movie. Also centers around the concept of love across the multiverse and how powerful of a force it is. Visually stunning. But the importance of the choice in the love we share, whether it is with family or our partners just made me sob. It was really a good movie to watch with my parents, actually. I felt like it strengthened our relationship to one another.</p>
